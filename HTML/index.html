      <h2>The Mark of Cain</h2>
      <p>
        What does the Bible say about Cain's mark? But the LORD said to him,
        "Not so ; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times
        over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him
        would kill him. So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in
        the land of Nod, east of Eden.
